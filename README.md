Spaceship can move right and left using A and D, 
shoot with machine gun bullets and laser bullets using P and reload using F;

Changing weapon is 1 for Machine Gun and 2 for Laser;

Unfortunately I had many problems with loading models, which took too much time, so enemies are just simple squares,
Collisions with spaceship and enemy bullets as well as enemies and spaceship bullets implemented.

Creating model of spaceship with help from Bj√∏rn-Richard Pedersen.

Here lies whole files and last compiled version and binaries of game is SpaceShooter.7z
