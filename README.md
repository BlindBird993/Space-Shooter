Spaceship can move right and left using A and D, 
shoot with mashinegun bullets and laser bullets using P and reload using F;

Unfortunately I had many problems with loading models, which took much time, so enemies are just simple squares,
Collisions with spaceship and enemy bullets as well as enemies and spaceship bullets implemented.
Creating model of spaceship with help from Bj√∏rn-Richard Pedersen.
